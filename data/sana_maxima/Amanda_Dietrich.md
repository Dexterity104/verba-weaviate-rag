**Assessment and Plan**:
- **Assessment**: The clinical presentation and history raise concerns for potential chemotherapy side effects or infectious complications. Differential diagnoses include chemotherapy toxicity, infection, or leukemia relapse.
- **Diagnostic Plan**:
  1. **Laboratory Tests**: Order a complete blood count, electrolytes, liver function tests, and markers of infection.
  2. **Imaging**: Recommend an immediate chest X-ray to rule out infectious processes.
  3. **Specialist Consultations**: Refer to oncology for potential adjustment of chemotherapy regimen and further evaluation.
- **Therapeutic Plan**:
  1. **Symptomatic Treatment**: Prescribe anti-emetics for nausea and analgesics for general discomfort.
  2. **Nutritional Support**: Consultation with a pediatric dietitian to optimize nutritional intake.
- **Follow-Up**: Arrange for a follow-up visit within one week or sooner if symptoms escalate.

**Orders and Prescriptions**:
- Routine blood work as listed in the diagnostic plan.
- Refills authorized for ongoing chemotherapy medications.
- New prescriptions issued for symptomatic management of nausea and pain.

**Side Effects of Treatment**:
- **Chemotherapy-Related**: Notable alopecia, intermittent nausea which is being managed with anti-emetics. Reports of mucositis have prompted a review and adjustment of oral care protocols.
- **Adverse Drug Reactions**: Methotrexate has caused mild liver enzyme elevations; monitoring continues. Vincristine has been associated with peripheral neuropathy; neurological evaluations are scheduled bi-monthly.

**Progress and Follow-Up Notes**:
- **Current Status**: Amanda has shown a partial response to the initial rounds of chemotherapy but exhibits significant treatment-related side effects which are impacting her quality of life.
- **Treatment Adjustments**: Oncology consultation resulted in a reduced dose of Methotrexate to mitigate liver toxicity. Supportive treatments have been enhanced to manage

 side effects more effectively.
- **Next Steps**: Scheduled for a follow-up consultation post-lab results to assess the need for further diagnostic investigations or treatment modifications.

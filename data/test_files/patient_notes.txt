An undiagnosed case of acute myeloid leukemia
A 43-year-old female patient reported to the Department of Periodontology, with the chief complaint of generalized bleeding gums, and gingival swelling from last 2 months. Patient gave no history of fever, malaise, weight loss in the recent past. Patient was not under any medication for chronic illness. Extra oral examination reveals bilateral submandibular and deep cervical lymphadenopathy; lymph nodes were indurated and tender on palpation. Systemic examination reveals mild hepatomegaly and splenomegaly.\nIntraoral examination revealed generalized enlargement of the maxillary and mandibular gingiva involving the buccal, lingual, and palatal aspects [Figure –]. The gingiva was swollen, inflamed, erythematous, and devoid of stippling. On palpation gingiva was firm and edematous, tender and bleeding on slight provocation. There was a fair amount of plaque and calculus, but did not justify the amount of enlargement. Orthopantomogram did not reveal any significant findings.\nThe following differential diagnoses were considered: Inflammatory enlargement, conditioned enlargement, systemic enlargement, and neoplastic enlargement.\nComplete blood count [] revealed marked increase in white blood cells, decrease in red blood cells with decrease in hemoglobin levels, and low platelets count; indicative of leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.\nPeripheral smear depicted numerous blast cells, mainly immature leukocytes with few erythrocytes and thrombocytes [].\nThese results confirmed the final diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia. Oral hygiene instruction was given to the patient. Patient was instructed to use soft bristle toothbrush, as gingiva was inflamed, friable and edematous use of hard or regular brush is not recommended. Thrice a day Chlorhexidine (0.2%) was prescribed as oral rinse.[] Scaling and root planning was postponed since the treatment needs a minimum platelet count of 60 000 in this condition. Patient was immediately referred to the oncology centre for further management, where bone marrow biopsy confirms acute myeloid leukemia M5 and chemotherapy started. Patient did not respond well to chemotherapy and succumbed to the disease within 10 days of admission.

Oral manifestations of acute myelomonocytic leukemia: a case report and review of the classification of leukemias
Abstract
Background: Oral signs and symptoms may indicate a serious underlying systemic disease. The most frequently observed oral findings of leukemia are mucosal bleeding and ulceration, petechiae, and gingival hyperplasia. This case report describes a 53-year-old male who presented with gingival enlargement and bleeding, fatigue, and recent weight loss as initial manifestations of acute myelomonocytic leukemia.

Methods: A gingival biopsy was performed, revealing the presence of a hypercellular infiltrate of atypical myeloid and monocytic cells. Further work-up consisted of a complete blood count, bone marrow biopsy, and immunohistochemical and histochemical analysis of biopsy material and flow cytometry of peripheral blood.

Results: Flow cytometry results confirmed that the infiltrate was of a myelomonocytic origin, and a diagnosis of acute myelomonocytic leukemia was rendered. The patient responded well to a chemotherapeutic induction regimen of cytosine arabinoside and idarubicin hydrochloride, with regression of gingival enlargement and remission of disease. The patient continued with consolidation chemotherapy and an autologous bone marrow transplant, but eventually died 22 months after initial diagnosis.

Conclusions: Oral health care professionals, especially periodontists, must recognize that gingival enlargement may represent an initial manifestation of an underlying systemic disease. Acute myelogenous leukemia is a hematological disorder with a predilection for gingival involvement.

Oral pathoses as diagnostic indicators in leukemia
A retrospective chart review of 500 leukemia patients was carried out to analyze the role of oral pathoses in the presentation of leukemia and to determine those factors which affect the frequency of oral involvement during the initial clinical phases of the disease. The data indicate that oral pathoses were frequent signs or symptoms in patients with undiagnosed acute leukemia but were less prevalent in patients with undiagnosed chronic leukemia. Neither age nor sex appeared to be a significant factor affecting oral involvement. Oral signs of thrombocytopenia were the most prevalent complaint of patients seeking diagnosis for their leukemia because of an oral problem, and they were also most frequently responsible for oral problems found at initial physical examination. Head and neck lymphadenopathy was also a frequent presenting sign or symptom. Dentists were responsible for initiating the diagnosis of leukemia in a significant number of patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia.

The clinicopathologic and histopathologic features of leukemic gingival and cutaneous "infiltrates" were studied in 1,076 adults hospitalized for cancer chemotherapy. Leukemic gingival hyperplasia was present in 3.6 percent and leukemia cutis in 3.1 percent of the patients. Only 7.6 percent of those with leukemic "infiltrates" had simultaneous gingival and skin involvement. Histologically, the lesions consisted of extravasated and proliferating monocytoid or myeloid cells. The infiltrative-proliferative tendency was most pronounced in patients with, in a sharply descending order, acute monocytic leukemia, acute myelomonocytic leukemia, and acute myelocytic leukemia. Formation of lesions in the skin and gingiva was unrelated to sex, age, and white blood cell count. Gingival lesions were particularly prone to infectious complications in patients with poor oral hygiene. Aside from the morphologic predisposition, the propensity for adults with leukemia to develop chemotherapeutically reversible malignant mucocutaneous lesions was highly individualistic and unpredictable.

Acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) are infrequent, yet highly malignant neoplasms responsible for a large number of cancer-related deaths. The incidence has been near stable over the last years. It continuously shows 2 peaks in occurrence in early childhood and later adulthood. With an incidence of 3.7 per 100,000 persons and an age-dependent mortality of 2.7 to nearly 18 per 100,000 persons, there is a rising awareness in the Western world of AML's special attributes resulting from an ever-aging population. To objectively describe epidemiologic data on this patient population, recent publications were evaluated to make transparent the current trends and facts. A review of the literature is presented, reflecting highlights of current research with respect to AML etiology. To estimate outcome and discuss informed treatment decisions with AML patients of different age groups and different biologic risk categories, it is mandatory to consider that the outcome results reported in clinical trials were until now heavily biased toward younger patients, whereas the overall dismal prognosis documented in population-based studies most likely reflects the exclusion of older patients from aggressive treatment. The etiology for most cases of AML is unclear, but a growing knowledge concerning leukemogenenic agents within chemotherapy regimens for other malignancies is already available. This includes specific associations of the most frequent balanced translocations in AML, including the "good-risk" abnormalities comprised by the core binding factor leukemias (i.e., AML with the translocation (8;21) and inversion of chromosome 16, and acute promyelocytic leukemia with the translocation (15;17)). In contrast to these genetic alterations, epigenetic lesions, e.g., promoter silencing by hypermethylation of the p15/INK4b and other genes, are increasingly recognized as important in the pathogenesis of AML.

Background: The aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the oral health of adult patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia.

Methods: Patients with initially diagnosed acute myeloid (AML) or lymphocytic (ALL) leukemia and a matched healthy control (HC) group were included. The oral investigation comprised inspection of the oral mucosa; the decayed (D), missing (M), and filled (F) teeth (DMF-T) index; and a detailed periodontal status. Subgingival biofilm samples were analyzed (polymerase chain reaction) for the presence of selected potentially periodontal pathogenic bacteria. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test, chi-squared test, and Mann-Whitney U test (significance level α = 5%).

Results: Thirty-nine patients with leukemia (AML 26, ALL 13) and 38 HCs were included. Oral mucosal findings were present in 62% of L compared to 0% of HC patients, whereby gingival hyperplasia was the most detected finding. Furthermore, a higher caries prevalence in leukemia patients was shown (D value 3.64 ± 3.98 vs. 0.72 ± 1.72, p < 0.01). The periodontal parameters were poorer in leukemia patients. No substantial differences in microbiological findings of selected bacteria were detected within L group and between L and HC patients.

Conclusion: The high prevalence of oral diseases supports the demand of an early and consequent dental treatment of leukemia patients, especially considering subsequent therapy.

Leukaemia is a neoplastic disease characterized by an excessive proliferation of immature white blood cells and their precursors. Oral lesions may be the presenting feature of acute leukaemias, which can be rapidly fatal if left untreated. This report describes the case of a 22-year-old female who presented to a dental emergency department with oral manifestations of acute leukaemia. It outlines the role of oral lesions in the diagnosis of acute leukaemias and emphasizes the importance of immediate referral by general dental practitioners.

Leukemia is a neoplastic disease characterized by an excessive proliferation of immature white blood cells and their precursors. Oral lesions may be the presenting feature of acute leukemia, which can be rapidly fatal if left untreated. Although many cases of gingival enlargement in patients with acute myeloid leukemia's have been reported in the literature, cases diagnosed by the oral manifestations in India are very few. This report describes the case of a 43-year-old female who presented with gingival bleeding and gingival enlargement. Within a month she developed signs and symptoms of systemic disease such as, and splenomegaly, and upon further investigation, she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia to which she succumbed within 10 days after diagnosis. The need for early diagnosis and referral of this fatal disease are also underline.
